# Automated-Mouse-Control-To-Tweet
A simple Project to open chrome, and to open twitter, login with the credentials and post a tweet on its own. Done using Keyboard and Mouse automation libraries.
It is done for a 1920x1080 display (you have to change the co-ordinates for different display size)
The co-ordinates need to be changed for the chrome location in taskbar(in my case the location was x= 651, y = 1048), You can easily find the accurate location using pyautogui.position() function.
